This is a simple Java Expense Tracker with a GUI built using JavaFX.

Project Structure:
- Expense.java — Model class for expense entries
- ExpenseManager.java — Handles logic for adding, saving, and loading expenses
- ExpenseTrackerConsole.java — Console version of the app
(The console version was the first iteration and contains some experimental code. The GUI version is the main working version.)
- ExpenseTrackerGUI.java — JavaFX GUI version (Main entry point for GUI)

To run the GUI:
- Open `ExpenseTrackerGUI.java`
- Run the `main` method
- Requires JavaFX SDK (e.g., javafx-sdk-17) or Maven JavaFX dependencies


Tested with Java 17 + JavaFX 17.
